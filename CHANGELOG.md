## [0.7.10] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **MCP**: tools no longer silently fail to appear in clients on slow
  filesystems (Docker Desktop VirtioFS on macOS, WSL2). The `initialize`
  handshake was blocking on opening the SQLite database and bootstrapping
  the tree-sitter WASM runtime, which on slow I/O could exceed Claude
  Code's ~30s handshake timeout — leaving the codegraph process alive but
  unresponsive and no tools visible. The handshake now returns immediately
  and defers project open to the background; tool calls wait on the
  in-flight init rather than racing it with a second open. Closes
  [#172](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/issues/172). Thanks to
  [@sashanclrp](https://github.com/sashanclrp) for the original report and
  detailed reproduction, and [@sgrimm](https://github.com/sgrimm) for the
  decisive wire capture that isolated the actual root cause.
- **CLI**: terminal output no longer mojibakes on Windows PowerShell /
  cmd.exe during `codegraph index` and `codegraph sync`. The shimmer
  progress renderer writes from a worker thread via `fs.writeSync(1, …)`
  to keep the animation smooth while the main thread is busy in SQLite,
  which bypasses Node's TTY-aware UTF-8→codepage conversion — so glyphs
  like `│ ◆ —` were emitted as raw UTF-8 bytes and reinterpreted as the
  console's OEM codepage (CP437, CP936, …), producing strings like
  `鋍?[0m 鉒?[0m Scanning files 鈥?N found`. CodeGraph now picks an ASCII
  glyph set on Windows by default (`| * -` instead of `│ ◆ —`); set
  `CODEGRAPH_UNICODE=1` to opt back into the Unicode glyphs (e.g. on
  pwsh 7 with UTF-8 codepage), or `CODEGRAPH_ASCII=1` on any platform to
  force ASCII (useful for log collectors / non-TTY pipelines). Closes
  [#168](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/issues/168). Thanks to
  [@starkleek](https://github.com/starkleek) for the report and to
  [@Bortlesboat](https://github.com/Bortlesboat) for the initial PR.
- **MCP / search**: module-qualified symbol lookups now resolve. The
  MCP tools (`codegraph_node`, `codegraph_callees`, `codegraph_impact`,
  …) accept `module::symbol` (Rust / C++ / Ruby), `Module.symbol`
  (TS / JS / Python), and `module/symbol` (path-style) — multi-level
  forms (`crate::configurator::stage_apply::run`) and Rust path
  prefixes (`crate`, `super`, `self`) are handled. Two underlying
  fixes:
    - The FTS5 query builder now treats `::` as a token separator
      instead of stripping it to nothing, so `stage_apply::run` no
      longer collapses to the unsearchable `stage_applyrun`.
    - `matchesSymbol` falls back to a file-path containment check when
      `qualifiedName` doesn't carry the module hierarchy (Rust file-
      level functions, Python free functions in a package): a `run`
      in `src/configurator/stage_apply.rs` now matches
      `stage_apply::run` because `stage_apply` appears as a path
      segment.
    - Qualified lookups that don't match the qualifier no longer fall
      through to fuzzy text matches — `stage_apply::nonexistent_fn`
      returns `null` instead of resolving to an unrelated `rollback`
      in the same file.
  Closes [#173](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/issues/173).
  Thanks to [@joselhurtado](https://github.com/joselhurtado) for the
  detailed reproduction.

[0.7.10]: https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/releases/tag/v0.7.10

## [0.7.8] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- **opencode**: install actually wires up the MCP server now. v0.7.7 wrote
  `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, but opencode reads `opencode.jsonc` by
  default — so the `codegraph` entry never showed up in any opencode session.
  The installer now prefers an existing `.jsonc`, falls back to `.json` when
  only that exists, and creates `.jsonc` for greenfield installs. **Re-run
  `codegraph install --target=opencode` after upgrading** so the entry lands
  in the file opencode actually reads.

### Added
- **opencode**: installer now writes `AGENTS.md` (global
  `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, local `./AGENTS.md`) with the same
  codegraph usage guidance the other agents already received. Without it,
  opencode's model would call native `Grep` instead of the `codegraph_*`
  tools it could see in its MCP list.
- User comments and formatting in `opencode.jsonc` survive install /
  re-install / uninstall round-trips — surgical edits via `jsonc-parser`
  rather than full-file rewrites.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Multi-agent installer** (closes [#137](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/issues/137)).
  `codegraph install` now opens with a multi-select prompt for **Claude Code**,
  **Cursor**, **Codex CLI**, and **opencode** — detected agents are pre-checked.
  Each writes its native MCP config + instructions file (e.g. `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
  + `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc`, `~/.codex/config.toml` + `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`,
  `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`). The runtime MCP server was already
  agent-agnostic; this brings the installer to parity.
- Non-interactive install flags for scripting / CI:
  `--target=<csv|auto|all|none>`, `--location=<global|local>`, `--yes`,
  `--no-permissions`, `--print-config <id>`.
- `codegraph init` now auto-wires project-local agent surfaces for any agent
  configured globally. In practice: Cursor's `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc`
  is dropped on `init` so a single global `codegraph install` works in every
  project you open — no per-project re-install needed.

### Fixed
- **Cursor**: globally-installed codegraph reported "not initialized" in every
  workspace because Cursor launches MCP-server subprocesses with the wrong
  working directory and doesn't pass `rootUri` in the MCP initialize call.
  We now inject `--path` into Cursor's MCP args — absolute path for local
  installs, `${workspaceFolder}` for global installs.

### Changed
- Agent-instructions template is now agent-agnostic. The previous template was
  inherited from the Claude-only era and prescribed "spawn an Explore agent" —
  a Claude Code-specific concept that confused Cursor's and Codex's agents and
  caused them to fall back to native grep even with codegraph available. The
  new template adds explicit "trust codegraph results, don't re-verify with
  grep" guidance and a clear tool-by-question matrix. Applies to
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc`, and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`.
- `codegraph install` prompt order: agent picker is now step 1, before the
  PATH-install and location prompts.
- Disambiguated "global" wording in install prompts ("Install codegraph CLI on
  your PATH?" vs "Apply agent configs to all your projects, or just this one?")
  — both used to say "Global" and read as duplicates.

### Internal
- New `AgentTarget` interface in `src/installer/targets/` — adding a 5th agent
  (Continue, Zed, Windsurf, …) is a new file + one entry in `registry.ts`.
- Hand-rolled TOML serializer for Codex (`src/installer/targets/toml.ts`) — no
  new dependency, scoped to the `[mcp_servers.codegraph]` table only, sibling
  tables and `[[array_of_tables]]` preserved verbatim.
- +47 parameterized contract tests across the 4 targets — install idempotency,
  sibling preservation, uninstall reverses install, byte-equal re-runs return
  `unchanged`, partial-state recovery for Codex.

Based on substantive draft by [@andreinknv](https://github.com/andreinknv)
([fork commit `c5165e4`](https://github.com/andreinknv/codegraph/commit/c5165e4)).
Thank you.

[0.7.7]: https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/releases/tag/v0.7.7

## [0.7.6] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- `codegraph` CLI failing with `zsh: permission denied: codegraph` after a fresh
  global install. The published 0.7.5 tarball shipped `dist/bin/codegraph.js`
  without the executable bit, so the shell refused to run it through the npm
  symlink. The build now `chmod +x`'s the binary before packing.

  Already on 0.7.5? Either upgrade to 0.7.6, or unblock yourself in place:
  ```bash
  chmod +x "$(npm root -g)/@colbymchenry/codegraph/dist/bin/codegraph.js"
  ```
